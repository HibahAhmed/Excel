## Overview of Project

### The Tabular Data table is used to help highlight different results through creating PivotChart and PivotTables. The data was not given to us in a way that was easy to understand. Therefore, every cell was changed to make it easier to understand. If it was days, it was converted to dates, and amounts of money were also made easier to comprehend. After it was all made readable, they were put into grpahs and tables that anyone would be able to comprehend.

### The Outcomes Based on Launch Date data displays a very large number of successfull theater outcomes throughout the year with May being the most successful and December being the lowest with a value of 37. There seem to be around twice the total number of successful threater outcomes when compared to the failed which had a total of 493 and the successful with a total of 839. January seem to have the mosst canceled and October had the least. The Outcomes based on Goal chart seems to show that as the precent failed increases over time as the percent successful stays decreases. The percentage canceled seems to be constant throughout. Overall, the major struggle I had was when I was creating the chart for Outcomes Based on Goals. It would get confusing at the beginning as it had so many parts to it. Another part that I found confusing at first was creatung the PivotCharts. It was easy to get confused with the steps. It was also difficult to stay motivated after getting stuck or confused.

## Results

### The Outcomes Based on Launch Date data displays a very large number of successfull theater outcomes throughout the year with May being the most successful and December being the lowest with a value of 37. There seem to be around twice the total number of successful threater outcomes when compared to the failed which had a total of 493 and the successful with a total of 839. January seem to have the mosst canceled and October had the least. The Outcomes based on Goal chart shows that the percentage of successful outcomes seen to decrease as the goal increases and the percentage failed slowly increases overtime. A limitations with this specific graph is that the success and failures are inversely related meaning that as one declines, the other increases. Its unneccasry to have both and it would be more sufficient to have both. I believe a pie chart would also be a good table to use to display the successes and failure.
